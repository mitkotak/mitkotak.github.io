Hiya ! I am  a senior in [Engineering Physics](http://catalog.illinois.edu/archivedacademiccatalogs/2020-2021/undergraduate/engineering/engineering-physics-bs/#degreerequirementstext) at [University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign](https://illinois.edu) and I am hoping to become a [systems person](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/1311_05-08_mickens.pdf) with the ability to breathe life into equations through simulations. My work lies at the intersection of Computational Science and High Performance Computing (HPC). For my graduate studies, I would like to adddress the various [exascale computing challenges](https://science.osti.gov/-/media/ascr/ascac/pdf/reports/Exascale_subcommittee_report.pdf) faced by different computational subfields. Since my sophomore year, I have been involved in research projects in Numerical Relativity, Scientific Computing and HPC Middlewares. My current research threads are:
- [3D Visualizations of Astrophysics Simulations](http://research.physics.illinois.edu/CTA/IRG/movies.html) with the Illinois Relativity Group led by [Prof. Stuart Shapiro](https://physics.illinois.edu/people/directory/profile/slshapir)
- Neutron star simulations with [Prof. Antonios Tsokaros](https://physics.illinois.edu/people/directory/profile/tsokaros) as a [SPIN intern](http://spin.ncsa.illinois.edu/interns/) at the [National Center for Supercomputing Center](https://www.ncsa.illinois.edu) (NCSA).
- Geospatial Middlewares with [Prof. Anand Padmanabhan](https://ggis.illinois.edu/directory/profile/apadmana) as a research intern at the [CyberGIS Center for Advanced Digital and Spatial Studies](http://cybergis.illinois.edu/).
- Senior thesis on GPU Computing with [Prof.  Andreas Klöckner](https://andreask.cs.illinois.edu/aboutme/) at the [Center for Exascale-enabled Design](https://ceesd.illinois.edu).
- Pesticide resistance monitoring frameworks with [Prof. Rebecca Smith](https://experts.illinois.edu/en/persons/rebecca-lee-smith) at [CDC-funded Midwest Center of Excellence in Vector-Borne Disease](https://www.cdc.gov/ncezid/dvbd/coevbd/midwest.html)

In addition to research, I also work as an [Undegraduate Research Ambassador](https://forms.illinois.edu/sec/1027002580) for the [Office of Undergraduate Research](https://www.undergradresearch.illinois.edu).
