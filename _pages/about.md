Hiya ! I am  a senior in Engineering Physics at UIUC. I have been involved in research projects in Numerical Relativity, Scientific Computing and HPC Middlewares.
I am currently working with the Illinois Relativity Group led by [Dr. Stuart Shapiro](https://physics.illinois.edu/people/directory/profile/slshapir) on [3D Visualizations of Astrophysics Simulations](http://research.physics.illinois.edu/CTA/IRG/movies.html). I am also involved in neutron star simulations as a [SPIN intern](http://spin.ncsa.illinois.edu/interns/) at the National Center for Supercomputing Center with [Professor Antonios Tsokaros](https://physics.illinois.edu/people/directory/profile/tsokaros). I am working as a research intern at the [CyberGIS Center for Advanced Digital and Spatial Studies](http://cybergis.illinois.edu/) under [Professor Anand Padmanabhan](https://ggis.illinois.edu/directory/profile/apadmana). For my senior thesis working with [Professor Andreas Kl√∂ckner](https://andreask.cs.illinois.edu/aboutme/) at the [Center for Exascale-enabled Design](https://ceesd.illinois.edu). In addition to research, I also work a [undegraduate research ambassador](https://forms.illinois.edu/sec/1027002580) for the Office of Undergraduate Research.
